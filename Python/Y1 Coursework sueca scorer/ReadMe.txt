During the first term of Computer Science (Games technology) during the foundations of computing modules programming I was expected to create a program to calculate the winner of a game of Sueca.
Sueca is a Portugese card games whch involves players 2 teams of 2 players competing to out rank the card played by each player based on a trump suit decided at the start of the game.
The file "suece_scorer" takes in a file with a similar format to the files in "sample_sueca_games" where the first line is the trump card, and the subsequent rows are the cards played by each player in each round. The file "homegame.sueca" is a game of sueca which I played with my family. The program worked as expected and even detect my teammate and brother playing an illegal card. The full file path needs be to entered in order for the program to be able to score the game.
 The coursework involved being given the name and purpose of each function/method in each file. I achived a mid 1st for this coursework.
